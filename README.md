The python code files are were used in the study: Random Forests in High-Energy Astrophyics

The yml file, initialFermi.yaml, contains the details on the conda environemnt used to run the below python code files.

InitialTesting: contains code and graphs created used to analyse the different features of the 3FGL catalogue. This was used to conduct pre-feature selection.

fermiAnalysis: contains code on feature selection and hyperparameter tuning of the model for the 3FGL data set. This file also contains the random forest model evaluation on the 3FGL test set data.

Compare4FGL: contains code on the 3FGL BCUs with 4FGL BL Lac or FSRQ assosiations evaluations and model performance.
